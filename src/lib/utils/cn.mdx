# cn

> A utility function for conditionally joining class names together. 

This is useful for dynamically applying classes based on certain conditions, such as whether a component is active or disabled.

```tsx
import { clsx, type ClassValue } from "clsx"
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge"

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs))
}
```
