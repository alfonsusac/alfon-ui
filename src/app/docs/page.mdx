# Introduction

**`alfon/ui`** is a collection of reusable components for building user interfaces in React applications. It provides a set of pre-designed components that can be easily integrated into your projects, allowing you to create consistent and visually appealing UIs quickly.

I plan to separate this collection into different parts to make it easier to maintain and use. 

1. **Headless Components**: The first part will be a set of components that are headless, meaning that they may not work if you don't provide your own styles. These components are designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing you to create your own styles and layouts. However they will come with default tokens that you can use to style them.

2. **Design System**: The second part will be the design tokens themselves that will be used to style the components. These tokens will be organized into different categories, such as colors, typography, spacing, and more. This will allow you to easily customize the look and feel of your application by simply changing the values of the tokens.
