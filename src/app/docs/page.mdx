# Introduction

**`alfon/ui`** is a collection of reusable components for building user interfaces in React applications. It provides a set of pre-designed components that can be easily integrated into your projects, allowing you to create consistent and visually appealing UIs quickly. 

It is heavily inspired by the [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) library, which provides a set of low-level primitives for building accessible and customizable UI components and shadcn/ui, which is a collection of components built on top of Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.

## Structure

I plan to separate this collection into different parts to make it easier to maintain and use. 

1. **Headless Components**: The first part will be a set of components that are headless, meaning that they may not work if you don't provide your own styles. These components are designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing you to create your own styles and layouts. However they will come with default tokens that you can use to style them.

2. **Design System**: The second part will be the design tokens themselves that will be used to style the components. These tokens will be organized into different categories, such as colors, typography, spacing, and more. This will allow you to easily customize the look and feel of your application by simply changing the values of the tokens.

## Goal

- **Reduce friction for developers** by offering reusable components and design tokens, enabling them to focus on building apps instead of low-level implementation details.
- **Speed up development** and improve code quality through a consistent, well-structured UI toolkit.
- **Support learning** by providing educational resources for developers new to React and UI development.
